## ImageCaptureTool
A simple tool that enables a large number of images to be captured from a user's webcam in a relatively short period of time. This is often useful when generating image datasets for machine learning models.

# Usage
- To run the main application, execute `python3 run.py`
- To clear all images present in a directory (this was particularly useful in testing!), execute `python3 run.py -clear <path>` where `<path>` is the directory's relative path from the current working directory

# Dependancies
- Python 3
- PyQt6
